# House_Price_Predict


This project predicts house prices based on simple features like area, location, and number of rooms.

Itâ€™s built using Python and Scikit-learn, with a basic Linear Regression model. The data is preprocessed using feature scaling and one-hot encoding to make the predictions more accurate.


##  What it does

- Takes a small dataset of houses
- Prepares the data (scales numbers and encodes locations)
- Trains a model to estimate house prices
- Shows how well the model performs


##  How to run it

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python house_price_prediction.py
